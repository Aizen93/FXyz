/**
 *  This is a placeholder for an up and coming (in the works) 3D texture
 *  management / creation / editing utility.
 * 
 *  Basic concept: 
 *      Supply a diffuseMap: -
 *          collect: -
 *              bump(normal)Map, specularMap, illuminationMap
 * 
 *              
 * Using basic standard approaches, apply image filtering
 * for specific "Map Type"s.
 * 
 * Allow editing of each predefined filter(s) parameters.
 * Considering: 
 *      Layers, 
 *      adding additional filters, 
 *      drawing / painting direct or from new blank "canvas"
 *      editing ImagePattern(s) / Palette(s) creation
 *
